# AirSim
CS485-104 Final Project by William Kaminski, Patrick Krawczyk

A modification of https://github.com/matthias-research/pages/blob/master/tenMinutePhysics/17-fluidSim.html.
Our goal was to add wind interaction with solid objects. We added a variety of objects with varying aerodynamic efficiency. We also added sliders to adjust parameters such as smoke velocity, smoke thickness, and object size so users can experiment and get different results.

## How to Run

Simply download the smoke.html file and run it in your browser! It is important to have javascript enabled and hardware acceleration turned on for the best performance.
